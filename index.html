    <h2>Proper Usage</h2>
    <p>The Doto bot was made for DOTA2 communities to help new players. You can use these commands however you want on your server, as long as what you are doing does not violate Discord's TOS.</p>
    <p>The Doto bot stores channelIDs, guildIDs, and userIDs. We ONLY store IDs if the bot needs them to complete actions on your server. If you want to delete your data, please disable the systems that store it. You can also contact our support server to request deletion of personal data.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <footer>Please consider checking this page frequently, as our TOS may change.</footer>
